# Teaching computational thinking and practice

A minisymposium proposal for the [SIAM Conference on Computational Science &
Engineering](http://www.siam.org/meetings/cse15) in Salt Lake City, UT in
2015.

## Summary

As dependence on computational tools increases, so does the need for better
computational training.
We discuss our own efforts to provide such training.
We address several larger questions including:
What is the role of computational training in our various fields?
How can we scale training to meet demand?
What technologies, languages, principles, and practices should we teach?
What is the right balance between conceptual learning and hands-on training and practice?
More generally, how should we train the next generation of
scientists, statisticians, and engineers in computational methods and
practices?

We frame the minisymposium in the context of our
experience teaching computing with data to undergraduates.
We discuss our recent efforts to automate grading student computational
work in Python and R.
Automating grading can improve pedagogy by
making it easier to assign students more work,
reducing latency in providing feedback,
and enabling TAs to spend more time working directly with students
by freeing them from the "busy work" of grading.
